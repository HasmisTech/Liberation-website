          <h3>Arabic Studies</h3>
          <p>
Arabic is the first language for more than 250 million people

mysterious and challenging and many may find its beauty
exactly in this. In fact, Arabic is not as difficult as it may
appear and if you have interest, Liberation Schools are betterplaces to come. </p>
